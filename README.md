Coursera - Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
==============

This repository contains the files for the Course Project:
* run_analysis.R - A R script for reading the [UCI HAR Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) and outputing tidy-data.txt.
* CodeBook.md - A data dictionary for tidy-data.txt.
* README.md - This file.

The script will download the data if it is not found in the working directory.

The resulting tidy-data.txt is a comma-separated file, with column names.
