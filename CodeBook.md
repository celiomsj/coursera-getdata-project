Code Book
=========

This is a code book for the data created by run_analysis.R for Coursera's Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project.

The data is from [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). The script provided joins the mean() and std() measurements of the provided test and train subjects sensors measurements.
